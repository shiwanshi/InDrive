# Problem Statement
Time and again social platforms have acquainted us with visuals surfacing online concerning the safety of passengers (especially women and children) as well as accidents of drivers.
Prevention and Control are the basics that we have incorporated into our solution to ensure robust safety.

# Features for Drivers
# Sleep Detection
Travel fatigue is real. To combat this, we provide a camera-enabled Sleep Detection system that can be enabled simply on the Driver's Phone. It alerts the Driver & passenger if the driver is "Drowsy" or "Sleeping" during a ride. A "Buzz Call" is automatically sent to wake up the driver.

# Safe Routes
Accident-prone routes lead to jammed ways causing unexpected delays. To the rescue, we present "Safe Routes" that can display Accident-prone areas and suggest alternate routes and a platform to report them with proof. This would not only help travelers and drivers avoid accidents but also complete rides faster.

# Help Forum
A networking platform for drivers to check if passengers have been flagged for "Misbehavior" before accepting the ride or report a passenger's misconduct. Some DIY tutorials are also incorporated on the platform to empower and educate drivers to handle emergency situations.

# Features for Users
# For Passenger with Children
Book Baby seats for kids of various age groups to ensure ride safety. They can also request for Baby Aid (band-aids, Antiseptics for injury,etc.)

# For Female passengers
Female drivers can be requested during late-night travel
Live-location sharing, if opted, shares location link to emergency contacts (Message and WhatsApp support)
# Fake Call: 
If the woman traveler senses danger, she can pretend to be talking on a call so that she psychologically tricks the nearby people into believing that she is being tracked.

# Shake for "Help" (SOS):
When in danger, the passenger(if mute or unable to speak in fear) can shake her device violently for 5 seconds. This sends an SMS to the emergency contacts with their live-location link.
